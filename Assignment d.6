QN-1.1.
The formula to calculate estimate
Hadoop storage (H): H=crS/(1-i)

where: c = average compression ratio.
It depends on size of the data and  type of compression used (Snappy, LZOP, ...) and  
In the case 
When no compression is used,
* c=1. 
* r = replication factor.
so It is usually 3 in a production cluster.
* S = size of data to be moved to Hadoop.
 so it is a combination of incremental and datahistorical data  . The incremental data may be a example and projected over a 
period of time
* i = intermediate factor. 
It is usually 1/3 or 1/4. Hadoop's working space for storing 
the results of Map phase Data Size – 600 TB 
Replication factor – 3 
Intermediate data – 1/4
Total Storage requirement – 13600/(1-1/4) = 2400 TB
Available disk size for storage – 7 TB 
Total number of required data nodes (approx.): 2400/7 = 350 machines

Actual Calculation(Including compression ratio and disk space utilisation)
Disk space utilization factor– 65 % (it differs on business to business)
Compression ratio – 2.3
Total Storage requirement – 2400/2.3 = 1043.5 TB 
Available disk size for storage – 70.65 = 4.55 TB
Total number of required data nodes (approx.): 1043.5/4.55 = 230 machines 
Actual usable cluster size (100 %): (2307*2.3)/4 = 1058 TB 

QN-2 Imagine that you are uploading a file of 500MB into HDFS.

1.let us we are assume that using a Hadoop
2.So, during this process if 1st block of 100 MB is written to HDFS and then the next block has been started by the cl 
Only the current block being written will not be visible by the readers.
3. Once the block is copied and replicated to the datanodes, client will get the confirmation about the Block 1 storage and then, 
it will initiate the same process for next block “Block 2”.Now block 2 will be write on DataNode as per permission given by namenode 
4. we have configured the block size to be 100 MB and replication factor of 3 2.So we have 5 blocks 1,2,3,4,5. 2.First client 
will ask Namenode and namenode after checking permission give the datanode where first bock(100Mb) is written and Datanode simultaneously
makes the namenode to getting permission after replicas of blocks .
